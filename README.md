# Note on Datasets
- The datasets exceed Github's maximum file size. However, they can be downloaded from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces and here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

## Instructions for running our code
- Load our .ipynb notebooks into Google Colab (highly recommended since we're running several neural network and CNN models which would otherwise take hours to run on CPU)
- Enable GPU boost on Google Colab
- Run the code in the notebook to download data and unzip to the Colab VM environment (we provide 2 options -- 1 using the Kaggle API, the other by mounting a Google Drive)
- Run the rest of the notebook cells
